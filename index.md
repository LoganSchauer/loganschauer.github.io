# I fix the hidden operational failures that successful businesses don't realize are slowly killing them.

Your business is growing, but your team is drowning. Customer data lives in seven different systems that don't talk to each other. Your highest-paid people spend 70% of their time on administrative tasks. Everyone's working harder while falling further behind. You've accepted these problems as the price of growth, but they're not. They're symptoms of operational infrastructure that hasn't evolved with your success.

## The Work

At Spaceman USA, I discovered what everyone had accepted as unchangeable: seven critical workflows that duplicated effort across departments. Technical service couldn't access customer success data. Sales promises didn't reach implementation teams. Information died in email chains while decisions waited for weekly meetings. I didn't just identify these problems—I eliminated them systematically, recovering 20-40 hours of productive time per week across teams.

These weren't unique problems. They're the same patterns I see in every scaling organization: the gap between how work supposedly flows and how it actually happens. The expensive software that nobody uses correctly. The manual processes that were "temporary" three years ago. The institutional knowledge that lives only in Sarah's head, and everyone prays Sarah never leaves.

## The 90-Day Transformation

I don't arrive with predetermined solutions. I excavate your actual workflows—not the ones in your documentation, but the shadow processes your team built to survive. I map where information flows and where it dies. I identify which complexity serves a purpose and which exists because nobody questioned it.

Then we rebuild. Not everything at once, but systematically. We implement changes that stick because they make life easier, not harder. We create systems that people actually use instead of work around. We measure the impact in hours reclaimed and errors eliminated, not in theoretical efficiency gains.

## Your Next Move

If you've read this far and recognized your organization in these descriptions, we should talk. If these problems seem theoretical or distant, we shouldn't.
