## I fix what everyone accepts as unfixable.

Experienced teams drowning in manual processes. Customer data scattered across seven systems. Your highest-paid people doing administrative work.

## The 90-Day Transformation

### Weeks 1-2: Discovery
I map your actual workflows, not the ones in your documentation.

### Weeks 3-6: Architecture  
We rebuild systems that people want to use, not work around.

### Weeks 7-12: Implementation
Changes that stick because they make life easier, not harder.
