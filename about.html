   <h1>I'm Logan Schauer.</h1>
   <p class="intro">I transform operational chaos into systematic excellence. But I didn't start here.</p>

   <div class="story-section">
       <h2>The Unconventional Path</h2>
       <p>My journey to operations consulting doesn't follow the typical trajectory. Eight years in university, four major changes, no degree. What looks like failure on paper was actually deep learning in disguise—I was unconsciously studying the patterns of broken systems across disciplines.</p>
       
       <p>While building my first LLC and freelancing for real estate and financial firms, I discovered my superpower: seeing inefficiencies others had accepted as permanent. I could walk into any business and spot the seven places where information died, where processes broke, where people were doing computers' jobs.</p>

       <p>When Spaceman USA posted a role, I made a choice that confused everyone: I quit university in my final year. Within 18 months, I'd been promoted twice and eliminated redundancies that were costing 20-40 hours weekly. I wasn't just fixing problems—I was teaching organizations they didn't have to live with them.</p>

           <div class="value">
               <h3>Ruthless Simplicity</h3>
               <p>Complex systems are usually simple systems that got corrupted over time.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="value">
               <h3>Evidence Over Opinion</h3>
               <p>I measure everything. Feelings don't fix workflows—data does.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="value">
               <h3>Teaching Over Doing</h3>
               <p>I don't build dependencies. I transfer capabilities.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="value">
               <h3>Speed Through Systems</h3>
               <p>Proper structure makes everything faster, not slower.</p>

       <h2>Beyond the Work</h2>
       <p>When I'm not eliminating operational friction, I'm mentoring youth through YMAN (Youth Mentoring Action Network) in Upland. There's something profound about helping young people see possibilities they didn't know existed—it's the same transformation I create in businesses, just applied to human potential.</p>
       
       <p>Based in Southern California, I work with growth-stage organizations nationwide. Whether it's a nonprofit drowning in compliance workflows or a service company whose technicians spend more time on paperwork than repairs, I see the patterns others miss.</p>
